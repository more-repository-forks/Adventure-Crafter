# Color Factory

An incremental game made using the game engine The Modding Tree (TMT for short).

## Starting Guide

You start with one color, **red**, which will give you some coins every three seconds.
You can upgrade its earnings with the coins you get.
At certain numbers, you will get a big boost in production, such as 10, 25, 50, or 100.
Once you get enough coins, you can unlock another color.
It will have higher base production but slower speed.
Keep upgrading and unlocking more colors until you can unlock the first prestige layer.
