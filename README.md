# Color Factory

An incremental game made using the game engine The Modding Tree (TMT for short).

### Starting Guide

You start with one color, <b>red</b>, which will give you some coins every three seconds.
You can upgrade its earnings with the coins you get.
At certain numbers, you will get a big boost in production, such as 10, 25, 50, or 100.
Once you get enough coins, you can unlock another color.
It will have higher base production but slower speed.
Keep upgrading and unlocking more colors, until you can unlock <b>Resets</b>.

### Reset Guide

When you <b>Reset</b>, you will get a random boost to one of three different aspects of a random unlocked color.
However, even though it's random, you can still strategize.
Keep doing more <b>Resets</b> and get a good spread of boosts, then aim to get the next color.
Each new color after the initial unlock will increase the amount of multiplier you get on the <b>Reset</b>.
So, keep getting more colors and multiplier, until you can unlock <b><i>feature not added yet</i></b>.
